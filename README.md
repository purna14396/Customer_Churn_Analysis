## 🎯 Objective

In today’s subscription economy, customer retention is more critical than ever. This project aims to:
- Identify churn-prone customer segments
- Understand reasons for churn using data analysis
- Predict churners using a machine learning model
- Deliver actionable insights using **Power BI Dashboards**

---

## 🏢 Project Context: Telecom Industry

Telecommunication companies face high churn rates due to competitive offers, service issues, and pricing concerns. This end-to-end churn analysis project helps businesses:
- Analyze customer behavior across demographics, geography, services, and billing
- Predict which customers are likely to churn
- Recommend targeted retention strategies

---

## 🧾 Dataset Overview

- 📂 7,043 rows × 30+ columns
- 📌 Attributes include:
  - **Demographics**: Gender, Age, Marital Status, State
  - **Services**: Internet Type, Online Security, Streaming Services
  - **Billing**: Monthly Charges, Total Revenue, Refunds
  - **Churn Info**: Customer Status, Category, Reason

## 🔄 Workflow Pipeline

### STEP 1 – ETL in SQL Server

- Cleaned & inserted raw data into `prod_Churn` table  
- Created views:
  - `vw_ChurnData` – Used for ML training
  - `vw_JoinData` – Used for predicting churners


**Remove null and insert the new data into Prod table**
```
SELECT 
    Customer_ID,
    Gender,
    Age,
    Married,
    State,
    Number_of_Referrals,
    Tenure_in_Months,
    ISNULL(Value_Deal, 'None') AS Value_Deal,
    Phone_Service,
    ISNULL(Multiple_Lines, 'No') As Multiple_Lines,
    Internet_Service,
    ISNULL(Internet_Type, 'None') AS Internet_Type,
    ISNULL(Online_Security, 'No') AS Online_Security,
    ISNULL(Online_Backup, 'No') AS Online_Backup,
    ISNULL(Device_Protection_Plan, 'No') AS Device_Protection_Plan,
    ISNULL(Premium_Support, 'No') AS Premium_Support,
    ISNULL(Streaming_TV, 'No') AS Streaming_TV,
    ISNULL(Streaming_Movies, 'No') AS Streaming_Movies,
    ISNULL(Streaming_Music, 'No') AS Streaming_Music,
    ISNULL(Unlimited_Data, 'No') AS Unlimited_Data,
    Contract,
    Paperless_Billing,
    Payment_Method,
    Monthly_Charge,
    Total_Charges,
    Total_Refunds,
    Total_Extra_Data_Charges,
    Total_Long_Distance_Charges,
    Total_Revenue,
    Customer_Status,
    ISNULL(Churn_Category, 'Others') AS Churn_Category,
    ISNULL(Churn_Reason , 'Others') AS Churn_Reason
 
INTO [db_Churn].[dbo].[prod_Churn]
FROM [db_Churn].[dbo].[stg_Churn];
```

**Create View for Power BI for prediction**
```
Create View vw_ChurnData as
    select * from prod_Churn where Customer_Status In ('Churned', 'Stayed')
 ```
``` 
Create View vw_JoinData as
    select * from prod_Churn where Customer_Status = 'Joined'
```

### STEP 2 – Power BI Data Modeling

- **Created buckets** for:  
  - Age Group: `<20`, `20–35`, `36–50`, `>50`
  - Monthly Charges: `<20`, `20–50`, `50–100`, `>100`
  - Tenure Group: `<6M`, `6–12M`, `12–18M`, `18–24M`, `>24M`
- Unpivoted service columns
- Calculated measures for Churn Rate, New Joiners, Total Revenue

### STEP 3 – Power BI Dashboard

## 🤖 STEP 4 – Machine Learning: Random Forest

### ✔️ Process:
- Used `vw_ChurnData` for training the model
- Encoded categorical variables using `LabelEncoder`
- Model trained using `RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)`
- Evaluated using:
  - Accuracy, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix
  - Feature importance visualization

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## 📈 STEP 5 – Predicting Churn on New Customers

- Used `vw_JoinData` as new input
- Predicted customer status → filtered for predicted churners
- Exported to CSV → connected back to Power BI

```python
new_predictions = rf_model.predict(new_data)
original_data['Customer_Status_Predicted'] = new_predictions
```
